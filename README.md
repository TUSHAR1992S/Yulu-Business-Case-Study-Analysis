Yulu Business Case Study Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Yulu, India's leading micro-mobility service provider, with the aim to identify and understand the factors affecting the demand for their shared electric cycles. The analysis is critical due to recent declines in Yulu's revenues and the need for strategic decisions to boost profitability and expand their market presence.

Business Problem
Yulu seeks to address the following key questions:

Significant Variables: Identify which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles.
Predictive Power: Evaluate how well these variables describe the demand for electric cycles.
Objectives
Strategic Expansion: Provide insights to support Yulu's expansion strategies within the Indian market.
Revenue Recovery: Analyze factors impacting demand to help Yulu make informed decisions to counter recent revenue declines.
Dataset
The dataset for this analysis can be accessed here.

Analysis Methodology
To achieve the objectives, the following concepts and tests are employed:

Bi-Variate Analysis
2-sample t-test
ANOVA
Chi-square test
Analysis Steps
Data Import & EDA: Import the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and characteristics.
Relationship Analysis: Establish relationships between the dependent variable (Count) and independent variables (Workingday, Weather, Season, etc.).
Hypothesis Testing: Use appropriate tests to evaluate:
The effect of working days on the number of electric cycles rented.
Differences in the number of cycles rented across different seasons.
Differences in the number of cycles rented under various weather conditions.
Dependency of weather on the season.
Statistical Tests: Perform tests including normality and equal variance checks (Histogram, Q-Q plot, Leveneâ€™s test, Shapiro-Wilk test).
Significance Testing: Set a significance level, calculate test statistics, and decide whether to accept or reject null hypotheses.
Inference: Draw inferences based on the analysis.
Conclusion
The results of this analysis will guide Yulu in understanding the demand dynamics of their shared electric cycles, helping them to strategize effectively for market expansion and revenue growth.
